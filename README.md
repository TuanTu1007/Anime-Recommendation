# ðŸŽ¯ Anime Recommendation System

A real-time anime recommendation system that predicts the rating a user might give to an anime based on historical viewing data.  
This project integrates **Apache Kafka** for streaming user activity and **Apache Spark Streaming** for real-time prediction using a pre-trained **deep learning model**.
